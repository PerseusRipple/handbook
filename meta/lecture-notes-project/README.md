# Adding lecture notes to the handbook

First off, thank you for helping to create a better, more solid curriculum. The effort to document what we are doing helps all parties involved: the staff, the community, the current students, and yourself.

## Main goal

The main goal of this effort is to help fill the handbook with content. We, the SDG academics team, have set up a curriculum to take folks from almost nothing to being a new, freshly minted developer. This powerful process has proven to work and, but only exists in a lecture format.

SDG is asking you to help us create documentation and formalize our curriculum by turning lectures into notes. The outcome will better disseminate the knowledge, and give both students and the community richer resources from which to learn.

## How

In its current format, the course is 12 weeks long with approximately 9 weeks of full-time lecture. This equals roughly 108 hours of lecture, content, and knowledge. This is where you come in.

There is a list of all the lectures we need to have added to the handbook at this [location](./lectures-to-do.md). Select the lecture that looks the most appealing to you and still outstanding. 

Take a lecture, watch the video, and create lecture notes using [these instructions](./contribution-instructions.md). These notes should follow [this format](./lecture-note-template.md). 

Don't worry too much about formatting or adding much more than what is in the video. These notes should not be a word for word dictation of what is said, but a written guide for the students to follow along with as a resource for homework and self-study. 

This effort is more about getting the content in the handbook, not so much as cleaning up the content.

When you are done with your notes, follow [these instructions](./contribution-instructions.md) to submit a pull request to the handbook. For this first pass, after you submit a pull request, an SDG team member will merge it and put the content in the current, correct spot in the curriculum.

After this first pass, we will be able to contribute straight to the handbook via pull request, but until we get more content and more structure, all contributors will be working closely with SDG staff.

Again, thank you for your help.
